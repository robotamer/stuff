2020-08-19T01:07:40Z	Been following twt on github. Although simple it's a great idea.
2020-08-25T14:55:26Z	Lora (Storm) passed by us last night. We are okay.
2020-09-04T01:49:28Z	@<james https://4069.twt.social/user/james/twtxt.txt> we are in Florida currently.  We had just arrived from the Bahamas where we ran to get away from Storm Isaias. Very busy storm season here in the Caribbean.
2020-09-04T01:59:40Z	@<james https://4069.twt.social/user/james/twtxt.txt> (re Storm) No wonder you couldn't find it.  The correct spelling is [Laura](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Laura)

2020-09-04T02:51:21Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Here is a suggestion for Twt. An Android app that would save twits to Drop box, Yandex, Google Drive, etc. public folders.
2020-09-04T03:03:28Z	@<selin https://4069.twt.social/user/selin/twtxt.txt> welcome to Twt
2020-09-04T20:04:15Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<wz6gbpq https://4069.twt.social/search?tag=wz6gbpq>) Not quite. Git is a good idea. I am thinking of having an Android up that imports data via Atom. Can save a twt file which then can be synced to a public Drop box folder, or git repo is good too.
